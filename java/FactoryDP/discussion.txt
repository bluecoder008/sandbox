advantages of Factory DP
------------------------

o De-coupling - of calling class and target classes:

  -> JDBC, we dont need to know the target datasources are using what type of
     database technologies, as long as they are supported in terms of the Abstract
     classes/interfaces such as Connection, Statement etc.

  -> For this example, we dont need to know what the specific PDF printer, Home or office 
     printers are, all we need is the kind of printer that can do the right job, and it may
     vary from computer to computer, environment to environment, but it does not matter the
     same DP still applies

o Dynamic Extensibility 

  -> The Factory Method pattern also makes programs dynamically extensible at runtime. 
     New concrete subclasses can be added to the system without recompiling the existing code.
     (GOF Patterns)

o Parallel Hierarchy
  
  -> The Factory methods also help in user cases where parallel class hierarchies are needed 
     A parallel class hierarchy is where every Product object also requires one or more 
     additional objects created (e.g. each Manager object also needs a Team object created, which
     also contain team members at least).
     (GOF Patterns)

disadvantages of Factory DP
---------------------------

  -> Bloat the number of classes, since each concrete class requires a creator class.
